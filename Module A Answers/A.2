Level 1:
1.) Research the history of "Mainframe Computers" Make notes of the following:

  a.) The first computers were the ENIAC and the successor was the UNIVAC. They took up entire rooms and used lot of power. The programming consisted of thousands of switches that were plugged or unplugged. The ENIAC was finished in 1946, it had 6000 switches and 17000 vacuum tudes. The successor to the ENIAC was the UNIVAC I, it had less vacuum tubes compared to the ENIAC from 17000 to 5000. The UNIVAC was capable of 1000 calculations per second. It was able to predict the Presidential Election results.
  
  b.) IBM 7030 Stretch super computer was not a commercial success but it was a visionary product that spawned revolutionary computing technologies that became widely adopted in the computer industry. IBM created many mainframe computers that would pave the way to modern day computing. Such as SABRE, which formed the backbone for American Airlines reservation system.
  
  c.) Many modern day mainframe computers have high security measure to prevent hacking and they are very efficient at completing multiple tasks at the same time while being energy efficient. Companies have stopped using personal computer in favor of terminals that access a mainframe system. 

Also the IBM System/360, which was a concept that had a family of computers using the same programming instructions, this would lead to the modern day computers to have interchangable parts.
With this much processing power, mainframes are used for many complex task such as research, space exploration, and data crunching.

2.) Research the history of "Super Computers". Make notes of the following:

  a.) The Cray-1 system was installed at Los Alamos National laboratory in 1976 and costed $8.8 million. It had a record of 160 million floating point operations per second. The design of the system contributed to the speed of the system, and no wire was longer than four feet. To cool this system, Cray designed innovative fridgeration using Freon. The Cray-2 was ten times faster than the Cray-1.
  
  b.) Massive Parallel Processing systems used multiple processor to work on  different parts of the program. Each processor uses its own operating system and memory.
  
  c.) Modern quantum computers are used for many complex task such as research, space exploration, and data crunching. Most research facilities have a super computer to calculate the complex task that the researchers require to discover new things.

3.) Research the history of "Personal Computers". Make notes of the following:

  a.) The IBM PC was introduced on August 12, 1981. It
  
  b.) HP made desktop sized porgrammable calculators.
